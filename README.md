# Flexible Content Body Parser

## DEPRECATED - Content API now provides blocks natively, use that functionality instead please!!!

Content API currently only exposes flexible content as conjoined blobs of
HTML.

This parser extracts the HTML into separate blocks, allowing you to more
easily manipulate the content.
